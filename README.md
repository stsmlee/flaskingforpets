# Flasking for Pets

This Flask web application uses Petfinder’s RESTful API to search for and return results for adoptable pets, using the user’s selected filters as parameters. 

Users can register and log in to save their searches, and then with one click (What’s News?), the app will check and notify the user whether or not there are new results for each saved search.

Registered users can manage their account, which includes deleting saved searches, changing nickname and/or password, and deleting their account altogether.

Registered users can also play the bonus minigame of Squeerdle. It is much like NYT’s Wordle, except users can:

  * Get a new random puzzle from the database on demand (instead of only one daily puzzle).
  
  * Keep track of incomplete puzzles and view completed puzzles.
  
  * Add new words to the database and send these words to others with known usernames.
  
  * Keep track of their created puzzles’ play and win counts.
